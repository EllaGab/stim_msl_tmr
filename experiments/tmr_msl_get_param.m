%% SEQUENCES

%% KEY-VALUE MAPPING

% For participants, each element in the sequence can be one of the four
% digits (1-4); each digit corresponds to a specific finger:
%   1 - the index finger
%   2 - the middle finger
%   3 - the ring finger
%   4 - the little finger

% Hands mapping
hands = [];

% DO NOT CHANGE THE ORGER OF THE DIGITS:
%   Keep it from the index to little finger

hands(end).digits = {'1', '2', '3', '4'};   % digits from the index to little finger
hands(end).keys = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};     % Keys that correspond to each digit

hands(end+1).desc = 'right';
hands(end).digits = {'1', '2', '3', '4'};   % digits from the index to little finger
hands(end).keys = {'4', '3', '2', '1'};     % Keys that correspond to each digit

% hands(end+1).desc = 'left';
% hands(end).digits = {'1', '2', '3', '4'};   % digits from the index to little finger
% hands(end).keys = {'1', '2', '3', '4'};     % Keys that correspond to each digit
% 
% hands(end+1).desc = 'right';
