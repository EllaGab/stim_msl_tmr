--- IMPLEMENT OR FIX

    >   PreSleep menu is updated and now contains two traning phases
        VALIDATED

    >   Change all the steps of the familiarization phases so that they can be run together with the scanning
        - Resolved by setting instructions' time; DEFAULT: 5 secs
        READY TO VALIDATE...

    >   Fix the size of the text when the participant makes a mistake initiating the performance
        (e.g., enters incorrectly the first two keys or uses a wrong hand)
        The text was shortened.
        READY TO VALIDATE...

    >   Save the output only after the performance block is completed (do not access the file during the performance)

	> 	Present only the remaining blocks if the session was previously initiated
		- The number of completed blocks should be saved in the param file

    >   Show the full feedback display during the training and tests
        - The viewer should be able to view all the results, right now the only first 
           few trail performance can be viewed. 

    >   Save the feedback performance data in text/csv files in output folder after performance


When done:
> hide the cursor
> remove the rsa key from the task computer


PSYCHTOOLBOX TIPS
------------------
Can use KbCheck & KbWait to determine whether any key is down now.

Pass a list of keycodes to be ignored by KbCheck and KbWait.
See "help DisableKeysForKbCheck" on how to do this.

---

Add a ListenChar(2) command at the beginning of your script and 
a ListenChar(0) to the end of your script to disable/enable transmission of 
keypresses to Matlab.

If your script should abort and your keyboard is dead,
press CTRL+C to reenable keyboard input
It is the same as ListenChar(0). See 'help ListenChar' for more info.

 'deviceNumber'
	-1, KbCheck will query all keyboard devices and
	return their "merged state" - The 'keyCode' vector will represent
	the state of all keys of all keyboards, and the 'keyIsDown' flag will be
	equal to one if at least one key on any of the keyboards is pressed.
	
	-2, KbCheck will query all keypad devices (if any) and
	return their "merged state", 
	
	-3, KbCheck will query all keyboard and keypad devices and
	return their "merged state".
