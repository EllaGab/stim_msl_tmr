% keys that are part a sequence at the very beginning or the very end of the block (head and tail, respectively) are not considered

% 
% INPUT
% keys                      a vector of keys
% onsets                    a vector of key onsets, i.e., the time that the key was presssed
% sequence      [integer]   a vector of numbers representing the sequence
% n_start_trial [integer]   the number of the first keys of the sequence to search for a trial; the default value is 2 keys
% n_sd          [integer]   the number of standard deviation; is used to exclude outliers
% only_iso_seq  [boolean]   1 - exclude sequences immediately before and after any error; the first sequences at the very beginning of each block are also excluded

% OUTPUT
% sequences     [cell array]
%   ....duration  	[double]    sequence duration; transition between sequences is not considered
%   ....transitions [double]    a vector of duraitons for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within each sequence and between the sequences
%
% transitions
%   ...n     	[integer]   a vector of the number of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within a sequence and between the sequences
%   ...n_out  	[integer]	a vector of the number of the outliers for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within a sequence and between the sequences
%   ...mean  	[double]  	a vector of mean duration of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within a sequence and between the sequences
%   ...sd   	[double]  	a vector of sd for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within a sequence and between the sequences
%   ...min  	[double]  	a vector of min duration of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within a sequence and between the sequences
%   ...max  	[double]  	a vector of max duration of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within a sequence and between the sequences
%
% transitions_for_each_sequence [double]
%   a matrix with vectors of duration of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... transitions within each sequence and between the sequences
