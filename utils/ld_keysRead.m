% INPUT
%   timeStartReading
%   duration            duration, in sec, before exiting; default - unlimited
%   nbKeys              number of keysPresses to press before exiting; default - unlimited
%   validKeys           cell array with valid input keys; default - any key
%   targetKeys          keys to be pressed, in order, to complete the task (default: no such keys)
%   acceptTtl           0 - the value of TTL (='5') is not accepted 
%   waitMax             the maximum time to wait without any key pressed;default - unlimited
%
% OUTPUT
%   quit                boolean     exited before the end (ESC)? (0: no; 1: yes)
%   waitMaxPassed       boolean     WaitMax is over and no response? (0: no; 1: yes)
%   targetKeysPressed   [boolean]   an array with booleans: 1 - if the target key was pressed; 0 - otherwise    
%   keysPressed         {string}    a cell array containing all the key names that were pressed
%   timePressed         [int]       a vector containing the time when the keysPressed were pressed
%   invalidKeyPressed   boolean     1 - if key that is not in keys4input is pressed
